      Hi, I'm Alan â€” a frontend developer based in Singapore. I enjoy building
      clean, intuitive interfaces and tools that make life easier for others
      (and myself). I care deeply about good design, thoughtful UX, and writing
      code that's both elegant and maintainable. I like exploring developer
      tools, automation, and occasionally, self-hosting odd little projects on
      my Raspberry Pi. When I'm not coding, I'm probably rock climbing,
      traveling, or tinkering with side projects. This blog is where I share
      ideas, experiments, and things I've learned along the way.
    </p>
