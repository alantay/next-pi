# Hey, I'm Alan.

<div className='font-body'>
I'm a developer who cares about building things that feel good to use, fast, accessible, and thoughtfully designed (with only the occasional overengineering).

I like clean code, clear communication, and naming things properly, even if it takes me 10 minutes to decide.

Things I do outside of work:

- Climb rocks to solve problems without a keyboard,
- Cycle long distances for Type 2 fun and strong calves,
- Cook garlic fried rice with too much garlic (if that's a thing) and chase the perfect Nyonya curry.

This site is where I write down what I'm learning, so I don't forget, and maybe it helps someone else.

If you build, break, or are just curious, we'll probably get along.
